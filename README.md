Hover is a minimalist PDF viewer extension designed for people who spend way too much time reading academic papers in the browser.
It intentionally keeps only the most essential features, but aims to make the actual _experience_ of reading papers smoother, faster, and uninterrupted by ---

You've guessed it: **Hopping between the content and the references**  
Hover solves that with inline citation preview popups that appear exactly where your cursor hovers, and lets you jump directly to the referenced paper in a new tab with one click.

The project is based on PDF.js, which means that you can also directly access the texts as html elements, if you're interested in taking advantage of this feature, feel free to fork it!

## Features

### Inline Citation Preview

Just hover your mouse over a citation and Hover  
→ instantly shows the full reference **right there**, in-context.  
And if the citation has a reachable URL or DOI?  
→ **Jump straight to the cited paper.**

### Floating Ball Navigation

Hover introduces a small draggable floating ball that acts as your navigation hub.

- **Drag it vertically** → scroll the document
- **Single click** → go to the **previous page**
- **Double click** → go to the **next page**
- **Left-click & hold** → open the **full mini toolbar**

It sounds silly, but it really makes paper reading feel more direct and tactile.

### Split window

Sometimes you gotta wonder, PDFs are longer than codes, so why isn't there a split window mode for most PDF readers?
Hover's got you covered! You can enable split mode to view the two parts of the document at the same time.
No more jumping between experiment results and metrics or figures and methodologies, enjoy doubling your reading speed without wasting time on scrolling around.

### Full Dark mode

Pulling an all-nighter reading papers? Sounds fun, why not dim the lights yourself!
With a click of the button, hover not only turns the background dark, it also renders the page in a soft black tone with white texts.
